This GitHub contains experiment code for how the cada algorithm performs with different community detection algorithms

File explanation:

  -vars.py : Stores variabels used in artificial_data.py and main.ipynb
  
  -cada.py : Contains a cada class that performs the cada algorithm and operations
  
  -artificial_data.py : Generates artificial data with the Newman-Watts-Strogatz model and injects it with anomalies
  
  -main.ipynb : Runs the experiments for the artificial data

  -RealData.ipynb :  Runs the experiments for the real data
  
Remaining files are to be cleaned up and exists only because of test purpuses
